## API Integration and Data Visualization

# This project demonstrates how to fetch real-time data from a public API using Python and convert it into meaningful visual insights. Using the OpenWeatherMap API (or any public API), I retrieved live data, processed the JSON response, and visualized important trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

# The script handles data fetching, cleaning, and plotting, while the visualization dashboard displays graphs such as temperature trends, comparisons, or statistical patterns. This task helped me understand API handling, data processing, and the creation of clear visual reports.

# Deliverables:
# ✔️ Python script for API integration
# ✔️ Data processing
# ✔️ Visualization dashboard using Matplotlib/Seaborn
